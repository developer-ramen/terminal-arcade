# Terminal Arcade üïπÔ∏è

It's just a bunch of games that plays in the terminal!

In detail, Terminal Arcade is an arcade machine *replica-concept-reinvention-do-it-myself* thingymajingy of the arcade machine!
The preceding sentence should have already given you enough context on how much thought and effort will go into this creation of mine.

## Purpose üîÅ

What, is **"terminal-arcade"** not clear enough on what this thing does?

Fine, I'll tell you. It's a collection of games (in no particular theme or pattern whatsoever) playable anytime, as long as you have a colored terminal and/or you're bored out of your mind or Internet's down.

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

Binaries are available in the [Releases](https://github.com/developer-ramen/terminal-arcade/releases) section of the GitHub repo! Can someone remind me to start distributing binaries?

This project is ~~re~~written in Rust ü¶Ä, and uses the Cargo üì¶ build tool/package manager.
Periodically, as new versions are released, I will also upload them to the [`crates.io`](https://crates.io) package registry.

If you understand what I just said, there is a _non-zero_ probability that you know how to run a Cargo project, but just in case:

1. Prerequisites: `gh`, `git`, or `cargo`

2. Use `gh`, `git`, or `cargo` to get your hands on ~~the booty~~ the crate:

    - If using `gh`, clone my repository like this: `gh repo clone developer-ramen/terminal-arcade`.
    - If using `git`, clone my repository like this: `git clone https://github.com/developer-ramen/terminal-arcade`. I don't know how to do it over SSH.
    - If using `cargo`, retrieve my crate as an executable with `cargo install terminal-arcade --locked`.

3. **_Run the dang thing!_**

    - Most likely, if you cloned this repository, you will need to manually `cargo run` it, or if you're paranoid that I ship buggy, unreliable software, `cargo test` to keep that anxiety in check.

Otherwise, happy gaming!
